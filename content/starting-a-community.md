Anybody at Lola.tech can start a community!

You only need a **name** for your community, and a **purpose**, and a **point of contact** (usually a channel in Lola.tech's slack).

Once you've decided on those you can add a page to this site (coming soon) and start planning your first **event**.

**Events** are our life-blood, we measure the vitality of a community by the participation in its events. If you participate in an event, you're a member of a community - simple as that.

If you're a community organiser you can get some ideas about events you can run without too much stress on our [Tips & Tricks](/tips-and-tricks) page (coming soon).
