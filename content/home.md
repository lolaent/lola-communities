*At Lola our communities are where we learn and grow. Each one is intended to be a supportive environment where individuals can improve their skills and where we can demonstrate our collective strengths.*

## Communities

A directory of our current communities, plus all you need to know about starting a new one.

## Events

A listing of community events, help for event organisers, and some ideas to inspire you.

## Participation

How to get involved, how to manage community time, and how communities help to grow your career.

## Changes

We're planning changes to the way that we organise and support Communities of Practice at Lola. The current system has a fixed number of CoPs, each led by a director. Colleagues are assigned to a CoP which is appropriate to their job role and are not normally participants in more than one CoP.

Whilst some of our current communities are very successful that's not always the case.

* The small number of communities make their focus very generalised
* It hasn't always seemed helpful to appoint a single director - especially in large communities with diverse interests
* In many cases an interest crosses CoP boundaries (GraphQL - for example)
* Having only a single CoP membership is restrictive
