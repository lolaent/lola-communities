## Dev things to keep in mind

This setup is in no way set in stone, currently it's just an initial setup so feel free to add/ modify things.

Keep in mind:
 - If you want to test changes made to your `config.yml` file locally, swap out `git-gateway` with `test-repo` and navigate to `localhost:8080/admin/index.html` to view Netlify CMS locally (you can't make changes or read actual content from Git this way, but it's great to verify how things will look).
